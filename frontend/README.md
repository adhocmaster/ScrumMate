# Frontend Guide for Scrum Tools

The crux of the frontend app is mainly run through the src folder. There are two folders, Components and Pages. The main file that runs the frontend is the App.js file in src. 

Components Folder:
- The components folder contains some of the components such as the navbar and the menubar.

Pages Folder:
- The pages folder contains the differnet pages that are used in the application which includes:
    - Dashboard (Redesigning): The main dashboard with an overview of projects.
    - Register/Login (Redesigning) : The registed page contains the UI for registering a user account. 
    - ReleasePlan (Redesigning): This page contains the release plan, including the proposed release date, high level goals, and user stories.
    - Sprint (Redesigning): Contains the sprints for the chosen project.

The UI makes use of the MUI library to reduce development time and to ensure that the pages are all formatted in a proper way.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
